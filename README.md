Our project, “Securing Academic Credentials with Tamper-Proof Verification,” tackles the global 
challenge of academic certificate fraud by leveraging blockchain technology. We developed a platform 
that enables instant, secure, and tamper-proof verification of academic credentials using unique 
blockchain-linked QR codes. This solution ensures authenticity, prevents forgery, and streamlines the 
verification process.
